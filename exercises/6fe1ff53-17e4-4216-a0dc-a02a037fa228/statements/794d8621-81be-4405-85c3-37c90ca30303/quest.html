<p> Create a program that displays a coded representation of a chessboard filled with eight Q's, which represents the specific positions where the Queen (chess) should be placed - see below.</p>
<ul>
<li> Queen checks all fields in the same lines: horizontal, vertical and diagonal.</li>
<li> Standard chessboard dimensions are 8 x 8.</li>
</ul>
<p> Write some code that finds out how to place 8 queens on a chessboard so that none of them can check another. </p>

<p> <br> The output for 8 queens should look just like this: </p>
<pre class="language-python"><code>
|Q|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|
|+|+|+|+|+|+|Q|+|
|+|+|+|+|Q|+|+|+|
|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|Q|
|+|Q|+|+|+|+|+|+|
|+|+|+|Q|+|+|+|+|
|+|+|+|+|+|Q|+|+|
|+|+|Q|+|+|+|+|+|</code></pre>
<p> <br> Hint: To store the momentary state of the solution, you can create a class Queens. The data structure is crucial. Instead of a two-dimensional 8x8 array, you can use four one-dimensional lists.</p>
