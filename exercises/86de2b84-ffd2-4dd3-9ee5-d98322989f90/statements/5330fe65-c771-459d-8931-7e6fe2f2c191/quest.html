<p>Define a function <i> rk </i> that takes three parameters: <i> a </i>, <i> b </i> and <i> c </i>, and returns the solution of the quadratic equation < i> ax </i> <sup> 2 </sup> + <i> bx </i> + <i> c </i> = 0. If the roots are two (delta), it is supposed to return two numbers; if one &ndash; (delta) one, and if they are not present &ndash; it is not supposed to return anything.</p>
