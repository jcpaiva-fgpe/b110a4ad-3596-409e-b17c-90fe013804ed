<p> The code below, the fib function is returning the n-th element of the Fibonacci sequence, but the biggest disadvantage is that for large n's the execution time might not only take several minutes to complete the calculation, for n over 50 that could take even many years.
Its inefficiency is due to multiple calls of the same function for the same parameters. 
Solve this problem by transforming a recursive solution into an iterative one, and apply the memoization technique, block the process of recursion when the value of the function has already been calculated. This requires storing the results of previous function calls. </p>
<p>Change also the message that will be displayed to the user. The character n should be replaced with the actual value of n, an example for: n = 1, fib(1) = 1. </p>
