<h4>5. Subsets and operations on sets</h4>
<br>
<p>The four basic operations on the sets are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>union,  e.g. x.union(y) or  x | y means the sum of sets x and y,</li>
  <li>intersection, e.g. x.intersection(y) or  x & y means the common part of the x and y sets,</li>
  <li>difference,  e.g. x.difference(y) or  x - y  is a set of elements of x that do not belong to y,</li>
  <li>symmetric_difference, e.g. x.symmetric_difference(y) or  x ^ y  means a set of elements that belong to x or y, but not to both at the same time.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>The following program uses two of the set methods. Unfortunately, they do not seem to be applied correctly. 
<br>Fix the bugs so that the results match your headings by modifying only the names of the methods you are using.</p>
