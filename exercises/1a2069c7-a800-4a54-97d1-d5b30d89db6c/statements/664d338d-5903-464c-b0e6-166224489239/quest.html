<p>Although Python provides the sorted function and the sort method, but consider the situation where the sorting function has to be manually implemented, below write the quicksort algorithm for a sequence of any random numbers.
<br>
Firstable, choose a certain threshold value m and divide the list into three parts l, c and r, containing elements: smaller, equal or greater than to the threshold value m. 
The same procedure should be repeated for parts l and r (in part c all values are identical), and then for smaller parts l and r obtained from their division, and so on. 
We continue the process until we get the parts l and r containing one element each, which can no longer be further divided. When there are no more parts to sort, the whole list is sorted. Print out all the elements of the list as presented in the skeleton below.</p>
