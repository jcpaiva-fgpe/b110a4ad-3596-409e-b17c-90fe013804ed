<p>Let us recall the code of the fib function returning the n-th element of the Fibonacci sequence, which took years to complete for n over 50.
Its inefficiency is due to multiple calls of the same function for the same parameters. 
Solve this problem by transforming a recursive solution into an iterative one, and apply the memoization technique, block the process of recursion when the value of the function has already been calculated. This requires storing the results of previous function calls.</p>
