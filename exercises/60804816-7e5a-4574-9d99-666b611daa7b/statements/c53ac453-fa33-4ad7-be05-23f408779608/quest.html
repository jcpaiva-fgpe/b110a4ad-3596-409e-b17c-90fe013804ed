<p>Define the <i> Rectangle </i> class such that: <ul>
<li> defaulted the lengths of both sides (<i> a </i> and <i> b </i>) to 1.0, <\ li>
<li> its constructor took two parameters (<i> a </i> and <i> b </i>) to define the lengths of the sides of the rectangle, </li>
<li> included <i> perimeter </i> and <i> area </i> methods calculating the perimeter and area of a rectangle with sides <i> a </i> and <i> b </i>, </li>
<li> displaying an object of this class would generate the text 'Rectangle (<i> a </i>, <i> b </i>)' where <i> a </i> and <i> b </i> should be replaced with the side lengths of the rectangle. </li> </ul>
Create an object of this class for sides with lengths 3 and 5 and store it in the variable <i> p </i>. Display the contents of this variable, followed by the perimeter and area of the rectangle it contains.</p>
