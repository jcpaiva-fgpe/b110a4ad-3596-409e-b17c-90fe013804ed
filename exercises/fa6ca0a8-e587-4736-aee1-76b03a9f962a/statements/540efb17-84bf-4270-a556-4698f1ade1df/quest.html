<p>1. Define a class <i> Figure </i> so that it will include: 
<ul><li> the method <i> perimeters </i> which is returning the perimeter calculated as the sum of the elements of the <i> side </i> attribute (which is a list; do not define this list for the Figure class, you will define it for child classes afterwards).</li>
<li> the method <i> __str__ </i> which is returning a text description of an object in the form of a class name and a list containing all sides of the shape &ndash; 
even if they have the same length all sides of a given figure should be displayed, e.g. for a square with the side length 7 (see below) the output will be: 'Square [7, 7, 7, 7]'.</ul> 
<br>

2. Then define the classes: <i> Square </i>, <i> Rectangle </i> and <i> RightTriangle </i> inheriting from the class <i> Figure </i> each. 
Also for all of them, define: 
<ul><li> the method <i> __init__ </i> taking one, two or three side lengths saving them as list items <i> sides </i> &ndash; note: to simplify the perimeter calculation, keep all sides of the figure, even if they are of the same length, e.g.
a square with side length 7 is to store a list <i> sides </i> equal to [7, 7, 7, 7], </li> 
<li> the method <i> area </i> calculating the area of ​​a given figure based on the data contained in the list <i> sides</i>.</li> </ul> 
<br>

3. Create a list of <i> figures </i> and place the following objects in its first three fields: <ul> 
<li> object of class <i> Square </i> for side length 7; </li>
<li> object of class <i> Rectangle </i> for sides with lengths 5, 6; </li> <li> object of class <i> TrojkatProstokatny </i> for sides lengths: 3, 4, 5. </li> </ul>
<br>
4. Use a <i> for </i> loop that will go through all elements of the <i> figures </i> list and print for each: a text representation of a figure, its perimeter, its area. 
For example, for the second figure the output might look exactly like this: 'Rectangle [5, 6, 5, 6] 22 30'.</p>
