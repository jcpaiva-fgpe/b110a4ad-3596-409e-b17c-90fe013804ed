<p>Write a program that reads some text from the user and counts the number of times each word appears in it. Use a dictionary to store the counter of individual words. 
    Display this dictionary at the end of the program. Don't use the <i> if </i> statement or the <i> count </i> method, instead use the <i> split </i> (string) and <i> 
        setdefault </i> (dictionary) methods, and The + operator. <br> Start the program and enter the string 'ram ram pam pam ram pam pam ram pam pam'. The expected result wil be: '{' ram ': 4,' pam ': 6}'.</p>
