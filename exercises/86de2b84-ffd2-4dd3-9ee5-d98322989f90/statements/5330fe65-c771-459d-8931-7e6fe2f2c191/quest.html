<p>Define a function <i> rk </i> that takes three parameters: <i> a </i>, <i> b </i> and <i> c </i>, 
and returns the solution of the quadratic equation < i> ax </i> <sup> 2 </sup> + <i> bx </i> + <i> c </i> = 0. 
According to the delta value, the end result differs if the roots are two, the function is supposed to return two numbers; if one &ndash; one, 
and if they are not any present &ndash; rk() is supposed to return None</p>
<p>Delta equals b^2-4ac</p>
