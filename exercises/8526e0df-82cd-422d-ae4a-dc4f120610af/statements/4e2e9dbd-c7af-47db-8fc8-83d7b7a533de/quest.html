<p>In Europe, the following denominations are in circulation: 1 euro cent, 2 euro cent, 5 euro cent, 10 euro cent, 20 euro cent, 50 euro cent, 1 Euro, 2 Euro, 5 Euro, 10 Euro, 20 Euro, 50 Euro, 100 Euro, 200 Euro, 500 Euro.
The value of the acquired products: <i> bill </i> and the customer's payment: <i> cash </i> are inputs to the program. </p>
<p> The program has to calculate how much money is left after completing the payment: r = cash - bill and display it. </p>
<p> Apply also some code that figures out the combination of denominations for the smallest feasible amount of coins and banknotes issued. </p>
<p> Display the result in the form: <i>(r = XX.XX Euro) XX Euro, X Euro, 0.X Euro, 0.0X Euro. </i> </p>
<br> <p> Consider the following scenario: cash = 200; bill = 171,24 </p>
<p> Output: (r = 28.76 Euro) 20 Euro, 5 Euro, 2 Euro, 1 Euro, 0.5 Euro, 0.2 Euro, 0.05 Euro, 0.01 Euro </p>
<p><br> Apply the rule to display only the Euro value coin in the Eurozone: 1 euro cent coin = 0.01 Euro. </p>
